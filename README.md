# Project-3: 💎Diamonds Showcase💎

## Overview 🌟

Welcome to the Diamonds Showcase! This project is part of the AI Bootcamp at OSU, where we delve into creating an interactive chatbot using cutting-edge technologies. In this project, we're leveraging Gradio for the user interface, integrating it with OpenAI for natural language processing, and DALL-E for image generation. Our goal is to build a conversational AI system that can provide information and generate images related to diamonds. 💬Did your boo thang get you a diamond that you want to learn more about? Come check out our chatbot!!!!!🔍🖼️

## Features 🚀

- **Chat Interface**: Utilize Gradio to create an intuitive chat interface for users to interact with the chatbot.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Integrate OpenAI's language model to understand and respond to user queries naturally.
- **Image Generation**: Leverage DALL-E's capabilities to generate images based on user requests related to diamonds.
- **Information Retrieval**: Provide users with information about diamonds, including pricing, characteristics, and more. 📊💡

## Pinecone 
Utilizing Pinecone and vectorizing text into chunks are crucial steps in improving the performance and efficiency of NLP text summarizers. Pinecone is a vector database service designed for handling high-dimensional vector data at scale, offering efficient storage and retrieval of vectorized data. Vectorizing text into chunks reduces dimensionality and preserves semantic information, allowing Pinecone to efficiently search for and retrieve the most relevant information. These techniques combined contribute to building a fast, efficient, and accurate NLP text summarization system.
